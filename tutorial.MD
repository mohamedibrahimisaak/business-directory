First in order to start from scratch we have to remove the boiler plate with the command:
    'npm run reset-project'
Now the app folder has only two files, the index.tsx and the _layout.tsx. All other folders and files have been moved to the app-example folder which you an delete if you want.
To run your app, you do:
    'npm run start'
